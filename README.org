*NOTE*: This project is in experimental phase currently. Expect rough edges,
unstable APIs, etc.

=nested-dir-local.el= provides a mechanism for users to place multiple
=.dir-locals.el= files throughout their codebase and have their values compose
based on the current buffer's path.

For instance, consider the following directory topology:

#+begin_example
foo/
|-.dir-locals.el
|-bar/
|  |-.dir-locals.el
|  |-baz/
|     |-.dir-locals.el
|     |-file
#+end_example

Say you open =foo/bar/baz/file= in a buffer. This package allows for the
configurations specified in each of =foo/.dir-locals.el=,
=foo/bar/.dir-locals.el=, and =foo/bar/baz/.dir-locals.el= to compose upon each
other to apply to the given buffer.
